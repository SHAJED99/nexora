# Design gaps — what the design doesn't cover, and what we'll do about it

Rule 2 has two halves. Every part of the provided design gets implemented as
accurately as possible **and** every journey it omits gets completed from the
BRD / SRS / feature list, consistent with the design that exists.

This file is the second half. Everything here is 🧍 human-approved before it is
built — "what should happen when the list is empty" is a product decision
wearing a UI costume.

**Method:** `agent/skills/design-fidelity/references/gaps.md`
**Rule:** a gap cites a spec id. No id → it's an idea, not a gap; ideas go to
the human. And no gap gets filled quietly inside an implementation task — that
is how a product acquires seven different empty states.

## GAP-001 — welcome, page background color not in the contract's token table
- **status:** 🟡 proposed
- **screen:** welcome (`design/screens/welcome.md`)
- **spec:** epics/E00-genesis/epic.md (genesis walking skeleton, no FR id — this is a genesis-scaffold token gap, not a feature/journey gap)
- **design shows:** the contract's measured token table has no page-background value (the Stitch golden capture's background reads through a light surface token, not a standalone page-bg entry)
- **derived from:** `lib/core/design/tokens.dart:14` (`welcomeBg = Color(0xFF0B1420)`) — approximated by the E00-T05 builder to give the welcome screen a background, not measured from the golden capture
- **proposal:** when the first real design-fidelity pass runs against the built app (post-genesis, see OQ-E00-3), re-measure the actual page background from `design/golden/welcome/default@390x844/probe.json` and replace this approximation with the measured value, or confirm it already matches and promote it into the contract's token table
- **approved by:** _<pending — flagged during E00 review, 2026-08-26; not blocking merge since the skeleton has no design-verify gate yet (OQ-E00-3)>_
- **built:** E00-T05 · golden extracted ⚪ (not yet re-verified against a running build)

_(no other gaps yet — the planner fills the rest while sharding the first UI epic)_

## The usual suspects

Checklist for the gap pass. In rough order of how often each is missed:

| Category | Typically missing from a design |
|---|---|
| Error states | validation, 401/403, 404, 500, network dead |
| Empty states | first-run, no results, filtered-to-nothing |
| Loading | skeletons, spinners, optimistic updates |
| Boundary data | very long strings, huge numbers, deep nesting |
| Whole journeys | password reset, invite, onboarding, offboarding |
| Permission variants | the same screen for a role with less access |
| Responsive | design shows desktop; the spec promises mobile |
| Confirmation | destructive-action dialogs |
